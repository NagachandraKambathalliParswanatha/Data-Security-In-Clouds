						<h1>Abstract</h1>

						<p>We propose a new decentralized access control scheme for
							secure data storage in clouds that supports anonymous
							authentication. In the proposed scheme, the cloud verifies the
							authenticity of the series without knowing the user’s identity
							before storing data. Our scheme also has the added feature of
							access control in which only valid users are able to decrypt the
							stored information. The scheme prevents replay attacks and
							supports creation, modification, and reading data stored in the
							cloud. We also address user revocation. Moreover, our
							authentication and access control scheme is decentralized and
							robust, unlike other access control schemes designed for clouds
							which are centralized. The communication, computation, and
							storage overheads are comparable to centralized approaches.</p>
